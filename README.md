Aliens are attacking Earth!!! Naturally. 
Alien Hunter is a two-player, matching-card game with audio and SFX. Take turns trying to blast aliens in the UFOs and take down that scum!

The game can be started immediately on load. The first player just clicks two UFO images and if they match, a point is scored.

The game records whose turn it is, and the score of each player - you may have to scroll up each time to see this info in the UI.

A HTML table records victories, and a certain number of victories by each player awards veteran, professional and elite medals.

There is a card preview that can be utilised once each round, giving both players a preset number of seconds to memorise the card positions. However, this preview MUST be used before any cards are clicked on at the start - otherwise you forfeit this ability for the remainder of that round.

Music and cards are randomly shuffled each round.

Buttons in the nav allow players to wipe the scoreboard and game history, whilst a reset option reloads the game.

Enjoy!
